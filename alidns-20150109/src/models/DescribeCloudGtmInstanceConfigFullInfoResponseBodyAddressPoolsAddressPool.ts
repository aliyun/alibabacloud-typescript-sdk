   * @remarks
   * Load balancing policy among addresses in the address pool:
   * - round_robin: Round-robin, for any source of DNS resolution requests, returns all addresses and rotates their order for each request.
   * - sequence: Sequential, for any source of DNS resolution requests, returns the address with the smaller sequence number (the sequence number indicates the priority of the address return, with smaller numbers having higher priority). If the address with the smaller sequence number is unavailable, the next address with a smaller sequence number is returned.
   * - weight: Weighted, supports setting different weight values for each address to realize returning addresses according to the weight ratio for resolution queries.
   * - source_nearest: Source-nearest, i.e., intelligent resolution function, where GTM can return different addresses based on the source of different DNS resolution requests, achieving the effect of users accessing nearby.
   * 
   * @example
   * round_robin
